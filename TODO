🙅‍♂️ Not in immediate scope :   
  ✘ Support for AWS hosted Dynamo (Currently we support only local dynamo) 
  ✘ Allow write to DB (Just a data viewer as of now, may remain so.) 
  ✘ Support for Multiple Tables 
  ✘ omit filters
  ✘ GSI view of data ( UI should be intuitive to consider this feature.😕)
  ✘ Don't take table names and key as user input, fetch from dynamo (will help in multi table support as well) | we might get more tables than we want. 🧐
  ✘ Explore Jotai to write idiomatic code for state management (if not already).
  ✘ sort items by column [preferred order] tagged union use case 🧐, field should be present in all items then only makes sense. what if we make it automatic like check if a field is present in all items.
  ✘ Add Readme file
